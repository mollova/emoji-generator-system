Gary Neville just ruined Carragher there #LIVARS 😂

When the USA does it, it’s called “show of force.” When others do it, it’s called intimidation. 😂

Southampton scored in the 72nd minute so the ball had probs just gone in the net when he’s clicking it 😂
Nuggets are a first round exit and it’s because Jokic only cares from December - February 😂

Riri how is Easter Season in Ibanda Everyone must be wanting money from you now 😂

Btw, this is why picks are not worthless. You never know whats gonna happen. I wish we didnt make it top 10 atleast top 3 or 5 but nobody saw the Mavs with a generational player going out sad like this (I begged for it tho). Smart to get Brunson outta there to help though 😂

SpongeBob tried to warn yall about them baby daddies 😂
Was so happy we won it took me an hour to remember I had laid us to win and was £60 out of pocket. 😂
Better to be quiet when you\re unsure, and let people think you\re stupid, than to open your mouth and prove it. I heard that enough times growing up to teach me to learn some facts before I go off on a tirade. 😂
Stop letting me stand on people furniture 😂
For the third time in a row. If Arsenal win the league, egos get bruised due to their boring fans. But if City win it, it’s a historical checkpoint. They did the 3peat. Our record gets shared. Same when Liverpool are about to win title no. 20. We want City winning over them 😂
Why do they wanna stick with this coach so bad? He’s clearly not up to it 😂
Thank you Brad! Just doing my part. GO BROWNS 😂
liverpool rattled! what a shit mentality club beefing the refs at half time despite getting away with so many fouls! they best get fined like we did and we just surrounded the ref #COYG #LIVARS 😂
Liverpool are goners!!! 😂
Martinelli goal and assist is even sweeter because klopp has wanted him at liverpool since the day he arrived at the prem 😂
You know him with errors but he is good shem that guy can win you 3 points 😂
First time he’s shown up in 3 years isn’t it 😂
White got booked for a perfect tackle &amp; Xhaka got booked for being pushed 😂
Xhaka is getting a red 1000% if he plays 90 mins. The man is unhinged 😂

Anfield na Arsenal training ground 😂
Its always Trent. Its always him some way or another. Every single goal. He is the worst right back in this entire league. What makes me cringe is our fans actually rate him #LFC #LIVARS 😂
How am i seeing Xhaka getting blamed for this you people are insane 😂
Gabriel kicked it onto Salah during Ramadan &amp; you think he won’t feast??? Lmao 😂

The way this country turns every Holiday into something for you to spend money is so funny. All they gotta do is assign a mascot and activity and it’s up! It’s Easter and instead of Jesus being the face, it’s the bunny w/eggs. Don’t even go to church but going to an egg hunt. 😂

That\s a nice way of deflecting from how did Russia manage to lose the Oskil despite the Russian MoD claiming the retreat across it was totally planned beforehand? The reality is that Ukraine wasn\t dumb enough to continue trying to advance in the mud season like Russia. 😂
How on earth did they stack everything up so high?!? 😂
5 time watch same reaction 😂
Anfield is nuts 😂
yh that was a bit exagerated 😂
 😂

Coincidentally, he just lived with Agbele in a drug house. Deloitte paid a large bonus (current top level employees don’t even earn such bonus). Coincidentally, his wife opened a business with Agbele’s wife and opened several bank accounts. 😂

If u really love khosi dont ship her thabang, my opinion though 😂
It happens. Honestly almost every Kpop acts puts me off even if their music is a good listen. It takes me to actually see the live performance to actually get hooked onto any artists. Thats why I stan BTS. I first came across lyrics, then music &amp; Live. 😂

A man pretending to be a women but it’s good money though with Bud Light and Nike sports bra the guy is now very rich just claiming he is an women, but he is smarter than most of us. He saw it coming and when finished he is an millionaire and laughing all the way to the bank 😂

You spotted an hater there 😂
Honestly how bad is Tierney, he has got to be the worst Ref in the Prem by some distance. Even the booking on Ben White wasn’t even a foul 😂
real, it depends on the day 😂
My main evidence for that is that he spent three years with her in the past and seems to have only spent a week or two traveling in the TARDIS with them before and after those three years 😂

Meanwhile, Pato OWard in that Indicar race at Texas Oval Speedway had 93 passes alone and overall more than 1000 passes in that race alone. Yes, it was a race on a oval track but still those cars have the ability to mantain, follow and overtake at over 220mph-230mph. 😂

Pedro Pascal is on a roll with all things urine 😂
That never happens 😂

Speechless .. 2 blokes dressed as women pretending to be women expecting us to believe that their women 😂

Saying nobody feared Bron before game but in game isn’t throwing shots. You niggas just some emotional crybaby ass bitches he said Jordan had niggas scared and they couldn’t lie about it. Bron didn’t have niggas scared until till off, in what world is that hating? 😂

Neither do I, But Magnus will beat me 3000 times if we play 2999+1 matches. And there is no Beth Harmon in real life, unfortunately. It is just you, me, Bobby Fisher, Kasparov, Magnus, with a couple of million others who get trashed by demonic So rating, please. 😂

Alison can pass but cant make saves ? 😂
My mother and her friends: Seun youre already getting fat. See your cheeks and thighs. Please reduce your food. Moral lesson for me: Stop wearing bumshorts around my mums friends 😂

Liverpool in the mud.. 😂
Nothing compared to the tradition of climbing trees, picking our nose on the sideline and spending the night at recruits houses. “Those that stay will lose in the playoffs if we get there” 😂
Even congress supporters dont take you seriously 😂
Same shit we have been watching all season where have you been?! 😂
White liberalism in a nut shell!!! They couldn’t be more wrong about Gen Z!!! Silent majority speaking up big time.. we don’t drink bud light and the people you should have been marketing to are sick or your shit being jammed down our throats!! 😂
Wishing he was closer! 😂
Yep, saw that and thought of etc etc 😂
So its the Gabriels taking over Liverpool as in Angel Gabriel ×2 no way #LIVARS 😂
Lmao Henderson asking AA wf is wrong with you... lovely scenes 😂
So he can be injured and sit on there bench, he’s been great for Mansfield 😂
So youre back to some other agenda 😂
Klopp rested his best players for this match. 😂
This arsenal title charge is going to be like Argentina’s World Cup charge…people are going to hate until they painfully realize the title has gone to arsenal 😂
Shey I no go join this movement bayi ? 😂
We are seriously living in INTERESTING TIMES 😂

He did not keep leeds up last year you do realise we finished in a lower league position last season than when he took over, right? &amp; as for leeds been a ‘consistently bottom 3 side’, you do realise we were never in the bottom 3 under the previous manager bielsa, right? 😂
Lol lets focus on UCL 😂
Oh no the kid is traumatized y’all too soft. 😂

Took a social media break and forgot to tell my AP. Where do I start from oh 😂
Our second amendment says otherwise 😂
Arsenal are back 😂
Its pool thats why 😂
Oh he’s absolutely a tosser. Almost forgot how much I hate all of them and their fans just because they’ve not been there this season to be hateable. Similar to United post-Fergie until recently though 😂
Lololol it was for a completely different show! But the line was long and they had ropes out to form the line so I could definitely see why people thought it was PL 😂
He looks confused about it. I sympathize, this is also me first thing in the morning! 😂
Bro we still have 9 more games to play. Please leave me alone 😂
Does she love you or does she love what you do for her 😂
Quite possible. I still didn’t expect as many pars as the players mustered in those tough conditions. Now we just need to tail each other on one line we really like and we’ll both profit from it 😂
Hahah exactly 😂
He really thought he was set but yeah it’s a trainer at my job that was sexually harassing the home girl and she said she finally reported it so he kinda just been a dead man walking not even knowing it. 😂
Van Dijk passing it to Martinelli for the first then letting Jesus have all the space he wants to nod the second home Arsenal this season have been making top players do bang average things, reason theyre top and probably winning it! 😂
Lmfao you women are secretive and hide in the obvious you can even have a man as we talk and nobody will have an idea, tweet or no tweet boo 😂

They already speaking to me in Spanish here 😂
Supreme Court justices arent supposed to make new friends? Clarence Thomas has been exactly what he has always been. Has ruled from the bench exactly as everyone expected he would, based on his prior history. Theres zero evidence his friend has influenced him in any way. 😂
They are just too good bro! 😂

Filthy kuffar. You where probably never a Muslim anyways. “If Islam real? Why no pray in shqipe?” Clearly you didn’t open the Quran and figure out why it’s in Arabic. 😂
Idk what kind of bloodclart love triangle I’ve been dashed into but the spoiling better start now 😂
and you’re fighting for conference league 😂
We eat beans and watch outsiders beating heroic in the final 😂
Je suis off 😂
Lmao rest. You seem to still be having PTSD from that 7-0 match 😂
Before the game they say we will definitely not win at Anfield, now they’re having a 10 minute spell we’re crumbling and it’s all Xhakas fault get these bias pricks off commentary, embarrassing 😂

Konate what a shit of a defender 😂
I didn\t even know that was happening on YouTube I used Brave browser\s Hide Element thing on Youtube\s main home button ages ago to hide the gay shit. 😂
Happy Easter Nax. Egg hunt is delayed until tomorrow. Twins aren’t happy about it but there big sister is out of town. 😂
The fans dy pissed 😂
However, what I am aware of is that there is a gap between what I think is good and what the public likes. In order to do that, we have to make something that is easy for everyone to understand. Hmm, a dilemma 😂
arsenal fans think they can win the league, i will be there 😂
This show is so stupid (affectionate) #SaveLegendsOfTomorrow 😂
Gherig with the lung dart!! 😂
Im sorry maguire you are better than this fraud 😂
Niggas using the personal experiences to generalize all women . Lames 😂

Cap told us mudryk was absolutely clear of Martenelli 😂
Or maybe Village people dey save You from loss this time 😂
Im with slow grandpa. 😂
You sound like Messi didn’t have high stats in other areas of playmaking. Let’s see Xavi’s stats for completed passes and take-ons and chances created and big chances created and chances created leading to goals and number of touches in opposition half. Look at this child! 😂
It certainly reads that way - don’t know why he can’t be more direct about it. M Martin may have something to do with toning it down. It’s obvious we need to plan for it. It’s only been 100 years + so maybe I’m expecting too much 😂
Tbh Beth does the same with de gea de gea made that 1v1 save and people said he just made up for his initial error everybody has an agenda on this app 😂
Must be nice living in a world where the answer to everything is ‘racism’ 😂

Keep on counting until you realise that now you are a normal human being 😂
Wow. That sounded so sincere and genuine, said no sane person ever. He’s done. Stick a fork in his ass and throw the ketchup packets away. Criminal should be in jail. Come on Georgia. Take his ass down with an indictment and watch all the turn on him in a millisecond 😂
Guys so shit he probably ain’t even playing him their. Moretime Trent out of position again 😂
Definitely not ! You are wrong! 😂
Liverpool fans and their swearing 😂

The pain of digesting what just happened. How much was it 😂
Lordy. What sort of mood were you in when you did that? We’re you thinking about the Tory government? 😂
All that for what UA to be the doormat of sports? It’s ok. You guys aren’t going to the big12 and no one is heading to the big10. Plus who cares if OSU hits the MWC. They’ll just make the playoffs every single year 😂
You are the real king 😂
I am really surprised that fans thought we can stop Arsenal Klopp made their mission easy with that lineup 😂
بتعمل حرب اهلية 😂
Nah this is AI 😂
The kept comparing him to terry 😂
Probably being proactive? loll 😂
Not very bright people thinking buying something, owning it then losing it by posting it to a brand is a ‘protest’ Go right ahead, dispose of your item and pay for postage to lose something you own. Total self own but go right ahead!!! 😂
Omg. I just binge watched Jury Duty on Amazon Prime and it was hilarious!! Its like watching the people of Pawnee from Parks and Rec be on a jury. 😂

Liverpool are actually balling, a goal is coming 😂
But there’s also former players praising him so it sounds personal 😂
The ship for bang but it’s better to just stay individual to avoid unnecessary drags for either party But their vibe is ; ; ; ; 😂
Klopp needs to revert back to flat back 4. They’re shocking trying to play this system 😂
This is priceless! 50 and tucker Read Vivica A. Fox And Tucker Carlson Were Rumored To Have Dated, But Is There Any Truth To It? on SmartNews: 😂

Joe joined the eagles 75-76 around the same time Jimmy Carter started running for President. The rock crowds all over started a write-in campaign for Joe Walsh! I was just a little kid but I remember my step Dad saying “those damn hippie’s are voting on a hippie” 😂
I also don’t understand anyone who calls me Kim. Are you ok? 😂

Ad hominem is a personal attack in lieu of an argument with warrants (that means reasons) that naturally lead to a conclusion. You’d learn that in a college Philosophy 101 course, so thanks for proving my point so quickly 😂
Lol He’s just good like that. Because some of us just trust Him off the rip, and some of us gotta take some Ls to get humbled before we listen. I was stubborn lmao so I took some Ls before I got real with Him 😂

I am not going to assume your age but I will blame it for your lack of football knowledge. Your flaw in this conversation is that you think every part of playmaking is tangible, enough to be quantified into basic stats. Go out an touch some grass. This sport isnt or you. 😂
cheers mate, appreciate it 😂
Why are they going on so much about xhaka 😂
The garage/side door is more convenient - the front house for guests and entertaining - I guess it’s to minimise the chances of breaking your grandmother’s porcelain on the what’s not I think it’s more convenience rather than slavery - at least IMO 😂

most skilled duo was healthy, stop with the excuses. kd had the second lowest fg%, lowest 3pt%, and the lowest +/- in a series where every game was close meaning the team you’re trying to downplay outplayed him and they could’ve won if he played better. it’s okay to say that. 😂

Thanks for handling this.. Chelsea fans act like Tuchel was all perfect.. Yes He was a great coach, won us trophies.. lost some too. But at a point his technique stopped clicking. Everyone was now on a ‘Hail Mary’. 😂

4 losses and a draw after? I’m alive 😂
Yeah you completely missed the point in all of this 😂

Shortly after rising Jesus fell over all by himself to win a free kick 😂

masters needs to chill on the streaming. I don’t understand why live TV cbs isn’t full coverage Thurs-Sunday. Instead we get the young and the restless and golf channel/ESPN running endless random interviews and side commentary 😂
Nice to see a bit of fight these days 😂
Oh Liverpool will win calm down 😂
Don’t blame the pc Nancy, just say your randoms are shit like everybody else 😂
Totally agree with you, millions well spent. Why did it take so long, right? Trump WAS impeached, indicted, and arrested just fine without the aid of courageous Republicans. But dont worry, there are more hearings to come... 😂

Hybrids are fans/stans of multiple artists so my point stands. You’re confusing hybrids and set up accounts. HANG IT UP. Even then if it is hybrid accounts posting DUDS, Block and unfollow, or report if it’s that serious to you. 😂
Its like Klopp knows were not winning week in week out so might as well try whatever game plan he has and if it doesnt work then it is what it is. 😂

Answer the question genius I knew you weird ass wouldn’t be able to. Why do it matter if it didn’t have any barring on the outcome of the game? Tell me what was it aboht the first 3 quarters that mattered more than the game winning drive in the 4th? I’m waiting 😂

I feel bad for the women that prematurely got their bodies done because the way my late 20’s “mature weight” just hit was something serious. I’ve never seen no shit like this in my life. 😂
Virgil Van Dijk is the most overrated player in the premier league, John O’Shea had more contributions in the league than him 😂
happy birthday to the gorgeous woman who be wanting all the smoke 😂

You’re strong but there’s a difference from a hostage situation and actually trying to defend your own property as if a single laser guided missile won’t erase you and your property from the map. You lost to a guy in a room pushing buttons 😂

You’re right, they’re not great are they. I was kinda glad they got together towards the end of the covid filming then they weren’t able to snog I like him with Sharon,they should get back together 😂
Seems Klopp asked Konate to go to the RB and Konate tl mark Martinelli. 😂
you’re talking to the wrong person about this cause bro is not a leaker 😂

I’m so happy I stayed in this weekend I needed the rest 😂

This is why Pep has always said you need to refresh a squad and get players who haven’t won much. You mix the achievers with the non-achieves and you get a proper squad. Also why he goes to clubs that can afford to do that, but then the streets say “checkbook manager” 😂
KD was doubled with the entire defensive attention on him at all times by the best defensive team in the NBA. He struggled, it happens. The Nets were never winning in 2021. The warriors dont make the playoffs when they’re hurt. The nets are somehow expected to win the finals? 😂
This is Anfield !!!! 😂

If you ever needed further evidence scousers are thick as fuck, they’ve spent years telling us Trent could play in midfield just because he can ping a ball whilst under zero pressure at RB #LIVARS 😂

Thats what I mean. You said it better. 😂
Someone please get Jesus to calm down The entire team needs to remain cool as ice, the Anfield crowd feeds on energy of every kind so let’s give them nothing. Starting the second half with a quick goal will go a way in quieting them 😂
Heart breakers. Once again. It’s what we do 😂
After reading all that I might sell can so without the stress, the government are willing to take them over for 6 years and maintain them, and you only have to give 6 months notice to get them back. But my tenants have been with me over 10’years so it’s a hard choice. 😂
Those field microphones are getting a nice work out by the Anfield faithful 😂
I can especially 😂
I don’t talk around them. I take all necessary precautions to make sure they don’t….but no never! They are fiercely independent unlike waterfowl. Some are just downright aggressive which is perfect. It’s the reason I love them so! 😂

Cricket mein I am never a fan; My principle is: Sahi karoge toh taaliyaan warna gaaliyaan .. I am very neutral &amp; will always praise the good &amp; point out the wrong .. After IPL 2018 &amp; 2019 I strongly felt that MS should have been the captain for the 2019 WC 😂

Don’t forget Liverpool also 😂
We need to start on some of you right now 😂
This keyboard warrior is missing a chip or two. Perhaps a cry for an intervention?. Her knock on fame’s door is obv missing a key. Analogous to her subpar writing. Her keyboard is lost So, when they stop talking, THEN worry!” Happy Easter 😂
Taxi for klopp 😂

This VVD performance 😂
Lmao that Scouse guy is screaming his head off near the mic 😂
 😂
Have you seen Trump take a sip from a glass of water? 😂
Not to brag. Even if you’re a sadist, my memes will always make you laugh 😂
Xhaka shouldn’t have done that but blaming him for conceding is wild we defended poorly and gave them confidence that’s it 😂
Idc what it is , if it say “Florida man” , I’m reading it 😂
Niggas be mad asf for nothing I wonnnn 😂

If your nigga got you posting.. NAVY’s, BOA, TD or tap in leave that nigga alone 😂
He quit his job to become a “freedom fighter.” He’s still upset about the water mark conflict and I think has repeated about it a dozen times. Micki is hangin around children. Now TT on phone. 😂
Konate is basically playing at RB because Trent can’t defend? So Van Dijk is playing at CB by himself 😂
Thoughts and prayers. 😂
i was just watching this episode last night 😂
I remember my homie shit got hacked it was down for like 3 months once.. entire PSN.. no new 2K roster or nun . I was mad for him 😂
Honestly, this is a tough match. I don’t want man city to win the Premier league, so I’m half rooting for Arsenal right now 😂
The campaign trail is crazy 😂
Soft free followed by a yellow card ignores for Saka, this ref still for Liverpool you think? 😂
Brother-in-law, you got the point. 😂

The time wasting by Arsenal 😂
those are facts. It’s how I was raised. We call it thoroughbred 😂
Yes. They keep bringing up stuff from over a decade ago. They want it to be Steffys fault so bad 😂
All of the kids are spoilt and entitled 😂

Instantly would be mad af. I’d just take my mic off and leave cuz why yal playin in my face fr 😂
Happy Easter to all who celebrate. Happy Sundayo those who dont. Enjoy your day. Im currently watching my two children argue over everything, ah sibling love. Also watching the youngest really get the candy. Opening and licking everything he got. 😂
Just a way to list Bears fans last. He adjusted it to remove the designations...Bears are still last. LOL even a Vikings fan couldn’t believe he listed our fans under bandwagon 😂
WHO TF IS PUSHA T? bro is still only relevant because of drake 😂
Hahah I definitely walked it off! My base camp is a protein breakfast and strategic snack breaks! 😂

Gosh the face everytime its iftar time 😂
I think if you have to say you are an influencer then you are not 😂
This so mtfn funny. 😂
Huh? How? 😂
Martinelli will stress your thighs o 😂
At some point Liverpool would score ahhh 😂
Morley, I’m going to spam his TikTok account after this game 😂
This one was taken by a friend I just met in this event I couldnt stop laughing 😂
but she makes up for it in cuteness 😂
Another arrogant mouthy nothing! Barbie really should shut it 😂
who’s that angry fan 😂
No wonder you’ve lost thousands with awful bets like that 😂
When your English teacher is on leave and your Maths teacher is substituting 😂
Sarcasm .. Its not for everyone? 😂
Its not a word, its an acronym for situation normal, all f**ked up Its a rather good description for situations that go pear-shaped 😂
Narcissist asf They like niggas who haven’t had bad bitches before 😂
My daughter is with me literally everywhere I go even if you think she ain’t wit me, she wit me 😂

Arsenal has won the league just give it to them already 😂
Sitw about to be crazy . 😂
Chimoo which church do they attend? 😂
… I’ll see you in the comments 😂
Remember when people said Virgil Van Dijk was the greatest centre back the PL has ever seen 😂
In this awful season I was still banking on this 😂
As someone who worked in icu through the pandemic. Our ICU doubled in size. Everyone had acute respiratory failure due to covid. Reading the responses on her makes me laugh 😂
Lmao pardon me bro. Idk why that popped in my head when I saw the pic but that’s where I’m at today! 😂
The ‘kid’ is 17 years old yeah ppl who start fighting at 27 usually become successful right 😂
Van Dijk plays like he’s stuck in the mud and we’re meant to believe he’s one of the best defenders of all time 😂
I cant believe we had to argue with people that van Dijk isnt one of the best defenders ever 😂
Played more Nox by Finally at 4p. This is a fast, vicious little card game that plays up to 6. Something tells me it would be wonderful bloody madness at 6. I lost…not even breaking 100 (150 triggers end game). 😂
Izzy said he don’t keep score he settles them. It’s like if he gave up 3 goals and said last one wins 😂
You know who hasnt forgot who Pusha T is? Drake. I bet you Drake remembers him real well. 😂
I know this game was controversial but this is the last RE game I played to completion 😂
Why did Xhaka have to wind them up 😂
Game over #Liverpool its over for you lot 😂
 😂
ok lets just pretend I didnt say anything 😂
Absolutely trolling and cashing in. Madness 😂
thats fair 😂
also what did puregym do to you fella 😂
That’s fair. I know performances play a pivotal part in the decision. From an outside view I definitely think Hearts should comfortably be up challenging with us and rangers with their squad depth and resources. Who do you think you’ll go for? Tempt Gerrard back up the road? 😂
You can see from comments that you are actually d mugu here. 😂
Hey now. I didn’t eat them but I sure sniffed them. Yup, I’m weird. I loved the smell of my crayon box when I popped that baby open. 😂

Wait, who thought the five heartbeats was a real group?!? Gosh, y’all tellin on ol ppl. They don’t teach y’all nothing bout music must be 😂
That tournament is actually rigged, i feel sorry for all the PPL who follow it so passionately 😂
I’m an ass for saying that I need to go on a time out 😂
If only Southampton had unlimited funds and good lawyers to get around FFP..... 😂
Lmao!! No frfr! it’s def one of those shows. Like why am I watching it, but I can’t stop 😂

And 1 minute later he makes a mistake for the goal 😂
You sound scared! Nice filter job on your photo though 😂
hateful person trying to stay relevant. 😂
That’s a crazy fucking picture 😂

He played vs Chelsea He think say Arsenal na Chelsea 😂
Just do it I promise it’s mad easy 😂
Its probably a good thing that I have no budget for production because if I could afford it I would totally be adding clips from Hamilton and The Simpsons into this episode, and while it would make me very happy, it probably wouldnt actually make it a better episode. 😂
The club is as unserious as its fans 😂
Oh I’m not bothered. I thought it was funny. 😂
Trent is proper shit ain’t he and Van Donkey for that matter 😂
8. I’ve not managed the other though like a (proper visit) to an F1 factory. I went to RBR once and checked out the trophies and show car but that was as far as we got before security said we had to leave 😂

Under 4.5 Card in first-half. Refree blows the whistle for first half. Happy like its a battle won, then Henderson decides to go fight the referee. Betting will humble you 😂
Been there 😂
Arsenal started to fall into that Anfield trap then. Needed half time to regroup and realise they’re still 2-1 up Should be a decent second half this, looks like it’s one moment away from really kicking off 😂
Only if he a loose ass nigga 😂

Sis he gotta take that L because he snatched tooo many souls 😂
Probably the worst book ever created 😂
Dutch treat makes sense now, as does the Dutch uncle who gives you harsh but realistic advice. And I\d always assumed these were just a bit of post-Anglo-Dutch war racism, like Dutch courage, Dutch build, Double Dutch and the obsolete Dutch nightingale - which is a frog. 😂

The Dog Tracker Nano is heavy and it’s not the cheapest. I was desperate and it has given me peace of mind. I pay £10 a month for the tracking. Tractive took mine back to “repair” it sat in Germany (could track it ) then they said nothing wrong. Wouldn’t refund either. 😂
But for sure I knew it was a mistake 😂
I’m 39 and a hot mess. I have to stretch for 20 minutes with bands, roll out with a foam roller, and it takes me 20 min to just work up to my starting weights for squats 😂
He’s no different to the ANC politicians 😂
He should ask Antony the last time he made a promise to Casemiro 😂

Bro Lmao the commentary back then was CRAZY they used to be wilding fr . Jerry mostly tho 😂
Van Disney was being compared to Vidic and Rio 😂

You can apparently defend anything. It is completely hypocritical. One of Putins main arguments for the invasion was to denazify Ukraine. Perhaps he should denazify his own country first. This just shows that Putin is a liar. 😂
 😂

Virgil van Dijk is such a brilliant defender isn’t he. He’s certainly done a lot for Arsenal already. The problem is that he’s supposed to be playing for Liverpool 😂

Utd fans cant stop talking about Liverpool 😂
Who is VVD marking? What is he even doing in the pitch? 😂
I keep waiting for our goals to get disallowed. Been rattled by Anfield for too long 😂

Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool version of Harry Maguire. Always pointing and screaming as if he is the best player on the pitch 😂
With me, I’m not yet happy with Each goal should be a loose in return 😂
Cheers. Still getting use to attacking football, goals and points, very unfamiliar territory. Glad it was Leeds that felt Roy’s new tactical ploys, . As you say everyone will be happy about the result. Shame you couldn’t get a point on Friday. 😂

Language matters a whole lot. After my Masters degree at UW-Madison I started work at the hottest tech company of the day, the Digital Equipment Corporation. They said I dropped out of grad school! 😂
Balls are clearly annoyed M isnt dating G. To them its offensive that he wanted to date someone else over their boy 😂
This mad Scouser swearing by the cameras is killing me 😂
Trent is the worst defender in the league 😂
 😂
Carragher just said it don’t make sense it must be quicker to teach Trent how to defend instead of how to play midfield 😂
They were calling my guy fat, he is the same exact size at madrid and this video 😂

Chelsea lion trying to run 😂

They are good Soldiers to perform police call before going to #BestRanger . If you can\t pick it up paint it 😂
Bro, I dunno how to strike convos 😂
I’m not over extending myself to nobody . Mfs be knowing what they be doing 😂
Typical Palestinian lies and victimhood. A lunatic from a modern day death cult drives into a crowd of people because the said lunatic wants to murder as many Jews as possible and kills an Italian tourist. Whos to blame? Israel 😂

Oh yh shit my mistake bro I completely forgot about that 😂
&amp; I took a piss on his headstone 😂
Where are all the Arteta out fans from 2-3 years ago 😂
If they don’t coordinate their suit case inventory properly in the movies then what’s the point? just like in the Witcher show, Roach doesn’t get stuck between trees once. 1/10 really 😂

Are you sure??? I don’t think so This fandom lies too much. No one forces you to lie like that. As everyone knows, your idols don’t pay you to say these things, so go find a job where you can collect something, instead of coming here to write these stupid things. 😂

Liverpool and Chelsea need prayers 😂
Some once claimed this man is the greatest premier league defender ever 😂

Gary Neville. Surely it’s got to be easier to teach Trent to be a right back than a midfielder. 😂
give them time 😂
100m ppl voted trump. That doesn’t mean shit 😂
Defended like Jalen? y’all act like he’s Dame or Steph! Literally nobody outside your fan base thinks Green is as good as y’all fan boys do. Go do grown up shit with your life. 😂
Liverpool fans leaving after 27 mins 😂
A month ago, I was seeing a movie. 😂
How tf did we lose 7 - 0 to these bums 😂
Very useless bunch we can’t even agend 😂
Gave Trent a free roam and he a right back 😂
Them Dutch Airlines trying to wipe these fawkers 😂
So where is ur own? 😂
That is so soft Yeah it sucks to get blown out but nobody owes you anything in that sense of the game. Super sensitive hahaha 😂
That’s basically Guan names specifically the Akposso tribe 😂
He slogged, went for single luckily 😂
The 3 atb thing with Trent in midfield, we havent done it all season, klopp decided to do it today. 😂
People still think Man City have a chance of winning the league! 😂

Imagine being a Nigerian and a Chelsea fan case study of failed projects 😂

Asia talking bout “I was here first why would he take you frm me”girl byeeeee 😂
No way this game ends without a red 😂
I learned that on new girl, didn’t know it was a real thing 😂
Yeah definitely, social media is the best tool in the world, consistently used the wrong way. Every time Glenn Jacobs posts another tweet I wish it was the 90’s where he didn’t speak 😂
Trent is so bad 😂
What about Perrin fight vs contender? You are conveniently skipping over that fight . Of course he looked worse last night than contender the competition wasn’t in the same ballpark. He held his own though and will be way better because it. 😂
Thank you x 😂

Clearly the Lord hath not reason in them just yet… maybe a lil too early… 😂
Lil sister 😂
Nah the fans in the back are killing me “ fucking knob head” 😂
There so many aspects of that tweet that are so funny but what stands out to me is how he lashed out at me under a football tweet, and even included my tribe. My tribesmen were just chilling 😂
Today na Jesus dae nau, he has the right to it 😂
oh my god jess this is gold 😂
Bro unfollowed/removed me as a follower and claims he isn’t sensitive.. 😂
A whole drama around a breakup of only a few days 😂
He sounds like he dropped his ice cream 😂
Scousers getting giddy 😂
Hell yea but i have samsung 😂
One good season best defender ever found out lad he’s a nervous wreck 😂
Our 2nd goal was only 3 passes 😂
You can see how much they love my company these days 😂
Dont know why but it seems true 😂
So I just read about that Music video Taylor shot in Liverpool &amp; apparently it’s got Joey King &amp; Taylor Lautner in… TAYLOR LAUTNER If that’s true, that’s wild 😂

No way that’s your sister 😂
Salah is available now 😂

Like Keith’s fat ass can win anything what a loser 😂
The only consolation Allison has is these guys are his country team-mates, because imagine facing these guys on international duty as well 😂
that’s cause I be chilling. The other side of me don’t really pop out as much but when it do its 100 on the gas no break 😂
Your taking the piss this defence can’t be that shit 😂
Of course one of these guys chimes in! 😂
I wake up actually worried I could’ve offended my coworkers. Then I double down and say out loud on my sofa “No, they got it and that motherfucker was being as white and male as he could.”. Then I calm down because it was just a dream. So I’m offended in my dreams 😂

Cycle is a motion for Swetha Chowdary 😂
I think MMA doesn’t work that way what happens in a fight is not predictable it depends on a lot of parameters and you can’t just say if if if. Everyone can lose and then say if if Also during their first fight Izzy had 4 more rounds to knock him out and he did not 😂
کاش میتونستم بیشتر نشونشون بدم:) 😂

A glimpse of Mo Salah recreating his iconic City goal. 😂
Clap ya hands together 😂
What made it worse is that the job took two hours to fail before I got an error. Then the errors went away and it ran for 18 hours before an OOM exception. I only found the issue because I saw GC Time was insane and started looking for lingering objects. Then I threw things 😂
Trent thinks he can play cm Klopp tryna be like his daddy pep 😂
I’m so glad I never got them pants.. y’all know the pants I’m talking about 😂
If I wasn’t old enough to be your auntie, I’d let you take me out for ice cream 😂

But yes, being awake during it is something else. I can imagine for someone who is not used to doing deep-dive introspective writing and descriptive writing on the reg, maybe they would struggle to express how it feels in such horrific detail 😂
380 pounds that’s how stupid boxing’s heavy weight is. Bro weighed 160 more than some of his opponents he was legit knocking people out like it was nothing. He would sleep the average Human in a street fight with 1 punch that nigga was too damn dangerous 😂

If pendu was the scorer of that Gabriel Jesus header, we were going to hear words such as “Mentality”, “Complete Footballer”, “Elite athlete”…… unfortunately, pendu is fizzling away in the desert #LIVARS 😂
My moms in 3 weeks at punta cana 😂
Cp3 not no superstar when have we called someone averaging 14 and 9 a superstar cp3 not even all star level anymore 😂
Cus I asked about film? I asked mr film about film and I get Insults and RPOs ok Monty you debate football off emotion I was just asking about film and you lashed out like a child insults and not giving me the info I asked for. You didn’t wanna tell me cus it was bad. 😂
You watch him attempt to tackle and you understand why he hates doing it 😂

Jesus getting on the end of a cross on Easter Sunday #AFC #Arsenal 😂
His fist is closed &amp; at his face idk how you missed that 😂
my kids would never behave in this manner. Every situation is different. We know nothing about this kids home life. 100% kid shouldn’t lay hands on anyone let alone a teacher. I’m simply saying the teacher could’ve let security handle it. Why’d he put himself in this situation 😂
I can’t relate to this experience so I’ll just take your word 😂
least that little shit was taught karmas a bitch maybe he shouldn’t do that again 😂
Yeah Alasdair your are right, your dog has become the star of the show ! If I dont see him during your vid Im not happy. 😂

Nah that ad was way too much 😂
Arsenal are getting rattled. Asif 😂
This Kid has more brains than most Politicians, forget todays illiterate generation. 😂
At least we know where Ben Davies learned his trade 😂
He is definitely using it to compare… This has been pendu fans’s modus operandi. Every accolade/football stat is valid for pendu but it’s rigged/useless for Messi!!! You young lads just keep digging holes for yourselves… 😂
It is a good suggestion 😂
I’ve got like 20 versions of myself And sometimes they confused my bf 😂
Wait till you know hes a messi hater 😂
The only positive of this weekend, but imagine getting sacked before Johnson 😂

Reading this makes me laugh lol 😂
